# Alpha-trim-and-adaptive-median-filter
<h1>The main idea</h1>
The main idea of both filters is to sort the pixel values 
in a neighborhood region with certain window size and then 
chose/calculate the single value from them and places it in the center of the window in a new image, 
see figure 1. This process is repeated for all pixels in the original image.
